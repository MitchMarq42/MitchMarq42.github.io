All my life I been searchin' for something
Something never comes, never leads to nothing
Nothing satisfies but I'm getting close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
---
Is this the real life
Is this just fantasy
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
---
Closing in on you, closing in on you
Run from the fire raining down on you
Closing in on you, closing in on you
oWo and no way out
