Surely you've noticed it by now. People know and use different definitions of relatively common words in English. I don't know how it is outside of English, I'm not there. All I know is, this approaches absurdity.</p><p>Now, the evolution of language is a known thing. A thing so widely known as to be tiresome. And, as an extension of this, we have on the inner layer of culture slang, and on the outer layer loan-words.</p><p>But now in the age of the Internet, slang moves faster than ever. In fact, I would go so far as to say that its current trajectory can be likened to a snowball rolling down a mountain: innocuous, but inexorably accelerating till it hits the ground.</p><p>What's the ground?
