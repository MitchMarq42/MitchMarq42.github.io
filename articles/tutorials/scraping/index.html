<code>= Introduction =</code>
I'll go over a bit more technicalities in my article on `grep`, but I wanted to discuss a practical use of UNIX command-line tools. This is also in relation to data-hoarding, but we'll get into that.

<code>= The problem =</code>
Detective Conan is a very long-running anime. It is basiscally season-less and has been running more-or-less continuously since 1996. As of the time of writing, there are 1036 episodes out, and every week that number ticks up by one. It's also not a masterpiece, so about 42% of that is filler.
The easy solution is to just not watch it, but I think we can do better. Here is how I found a list of canon/plot-relevant episodes, and extracted that into something to be used with various other tools at my disposal&#x2013; and how you can too!
</p>

<p>
-&#x2014;
</p>

<p>
First we google (or bing, or duck, or brave) for "detective conan list of important episodes". <a href="https://www.xerblade.com/p/detective-conan-important-episode-list.html?m=0%7CThis">https://www.xerblade.com/p/detective-conan-important-episode-list.html?m=0%7CThis</a> is the top result on Google and Brave, and is thankfully also the one I used in the past to come up with the following procedure.
</p>

<p>
In the browser, it's a pretty good page. Decorated but tasteful, modern but not bloated. Run basically by one guy, who strives to not use JavaScript as much as possible (an honorable goal).
</p>

<p>
But we're working in the command line. And on the command line, everything is reduced to plaintext. If you're lucky enough to not know what HTML looks like, here's a sample from the aformentioned page (obtained with `curl 'https://www.xerblade.com/p/detective-conan-important-episode-list.html?m=0'`):
</p>

<p>
{{{HTML
&lt;span class='dc-list-pos'&gt;&lt;span class='dc-list-no'&gt;*Main Plot*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class='dc-list-pos'&gt;&lt;span class='dc-list-no'&gt;971-974&lt;/span&gt; [INTL 1028-1031] (manga 1013-1017|V95F10-V96F3):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='dc-list-char'&gt;Detective &lt;span lang='ja-Latn'&gt;Chiba&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class='dc-list-char' lang='ja-Latn'&gt;Miike&lt;/span&gt; development. &lt;span class='dc-list-char' lang='ja-Latn'&gt;Kuroda&lt;/span&gt; development. &lt;span class='dc-list-char' lang='ja-Latn'&gt;Amuro&lt;/span&gt; development. Plus a development for &lt;span class='dc-list-char' lang='ja-Latn'&gt;Yumi&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class='dc-list-char' lang='ja-Latn'&gt;Shūkichi&lt;/span&gt; in the background. &lt;span class='dc-list-pos'&gt;&lt;span class='dc-list-no'&gt;*Main Plot*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class='dc-list-pos'&gt;&lt;span class='dc-list-no'&gt;983-984&lt;/span&gt; [INTL 1040-1041] (manga 1018-1021|V96F4-7):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='dc-list-char' lang='ja-Latn'&gt;Heiji&lt;/span&gt; case, &lt;span class='dc-list-char' lang='ja-Latn'&gt;Kaitō Kid&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class='dc-list-char' lang='ja-Latn'&gt;Morofushi&lt;/span&gt; development, &lt;span class='dc-list-char' lang='ja-Latn'&gt;Amuro&lt;/span&gt; development, and &lt;span class='dc-list-char' lang='ja-Latn'&gt;Hiromitsu&lt;/span&gt; development. &lt;span class='dc-list-pos'&gt;&lt;span class='dc-list-no'&gt;*Main Plot*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class='dc-list-pos'&gt;&lt;span class='dc-list-no'&gt;993-995&lt;/span&gt; [INTL 1050-1052] (manga 1022-1026|V96F8-V97F1):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='dc-list-char' lang='ja-Latn'&gt;Sera Masumi&lt;/span&gt; development. Also, &lt;
}}}
</p>

<p>
Sorry. You shouldn't have had to endure that. In fact, you probably didn't. I bet your eyes glazed over. In fact, this is just a segment from near the end of a <span class="underline">huge</span> pagagraph which actually contains everything we've been looking for. Obviously, just reading it like this isn't really doable. Let's chop it up into some better pieces.
</p>

<p>
`sed` is a stream editor. You give it a stream of text, and it applies a rule or conversion to the text according to the expression you put after it (the first <b>argument</b>.) It is often used for search-and-replace.
</p>

<p>
For example, we can convert every instance of `&gt;&lt;` to, say, `&gt; &lt;` or better yet to
    `&gt;`
    `&lt;`
. Here's the command now:
</p>

<p>
`curl 'https://www.xerblade.com/p/detective-conan-important-episode-list.html?m=0' | sed 's/&gt;&lt;/&gt;\n&lt;/g'`
</p>

<p>
The `s/thing1/thing2/g` tells `sed` to _S<sub>ubstitute</sub> thing1 with thing2 _G<sub>lobally</sub>, every time in the line. Without the `g` it would only do the first one (which is useful but not here). That `\n` is what's called a <b>regular expression</b>&#x2013; this one specifically means "newline". You often can't type an actual Enter character on the command line because it'll try to execute, so using `\n` works better.
</p>

<p>
Anyway.
</p>

<p>
Now the bits of that paragraph each look something like this:
{{{HTML
&lt;span class='dc-list-pos'&gt;
&lt;span class='dc-list-no'&gt;971-974&lt;/span&gt; [INTL 1028-1031] (manga 1013-1017|V95F10-V96F3):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='dc-list-char'&gt;Detective &lt;span lang='ja-Latn'&gt;Chiba&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class='dc-list-char' lang='ja-Latn'&gt;Miike&lt;/span&gt; development. &lt;span class='dc-list-char' lang='ja-Latn'&gt;Kuroda&lt;/span&gt; development. &lt;span class='dc-list-char' lang='ja-Latn'&gt;Amuro&lt;/span&gt; development. Plus a development for &lt;span class='dc-list-char' lang='ja-Latn'&gt;Yumi&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class='dc-list-char' lang='ja-Latn'&gt;Shūkichi&lt;/span&gt; in the background. &lt;span class='dc-list-pos'&gt;
&lt;span class='dc-list-no'&gt;*Main Plot*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
}}}
Not completely immune to overlong lines, but it's something.
Now pay attention to that line that says `class='dc-list-no'&gt;971-974&lt;/span&gt;`. If we go back to the browser and control-F 971-974 we find&#x2026; that there are no results because the page is portioned out per hundred episodes. Let's click on the 900s tab and try again.
</p>

<p>
Aaand it looks like this:
</p>

<p>
<b>971-974</b> [INTL 1028-1031] (manga 1013-1017|V95F10-V96F3): Detective Chiba and Miike development. Kuroda development. Amuro development. Plus a development for Yumi and Shūkichi in the background. \**Main Plot*\*
</p>

<p>
As you can see, the author has very kindly left a keyword next to every episode number or range that does not appear in the page itself: `dc-list-no`. Let's try `grep`ing the whole mess for that string.
</p>

<p>
`curl 'https://www.xerblade.com/p/detective-conan-important-episode-list.html?m=0' | sed 's/&gt;&lt;/&gt;\n&lt;/g' | grep 'dc-list-no'`
</p>

<p>
Now we end up with blocks that look like
{{{HTML
&lt;span class='dc-list-no'&gt;971-974&lt;/span&gt; [INTL 1028-1031] (manga 1013-1017|V95F10-V96F3):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='dc-list-char'&gt;Detective &lt;span lang='ja-Latn'&gt;Chiba&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class='dc-list-no'&gt;*Main Plot*&lt;/span&gt;
}}}
</p>

<p>
Hmmm. Not perfect. But we're getting there. Most lines now either contain the episode numbers like we want, or not much numbers at all. There are some like
{{{HTML
&lt;span class='dc-list-no'&gt;(Both 1 Hour Specials)&lt;/span&gt;
}}}
but that's probably alright as you'll see.
</p>

I'm just going to drop a link to <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html%7Cthe%20GNU%20online%20manual%20for%20%60sed%60">https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html%7Cthe%20GNU%20online%20manual%20for%20%60sed%60</a> here. It's a good reference.
</p>

<p>
Here I'll just leave it at this: `sed` is the successor of the ancient `ed` editor, and kind of has its own language. A language of editing. Of going to places in the stream, of operating on text objects in the line, of substituting and printing.
