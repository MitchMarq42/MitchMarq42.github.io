Does it not make you cry
When you&rsquo;re screamin'
Barely stop to wonder why
And I
Another lonely fool
It makes my brain ache,
To know, and wish to take
That last unstaged duel

My ears are not joined by a hole
It&rsquo;s one
Only one
One thing I need to know I&rsquo;ve done
Forget all else, that battle&rsquo;s won"><meta name=viewport content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1"><meta name=robots content="index, follow"><meta charset=utf-8></head><body><main><header><h1>Stupid poems I wrote one time and still have for some reason</h1></header><article><h1 id=stupidity>Stupidity</h1><p>Don&rsquo;t you hate it</p><p>Does it not make you cry</p><p>When you&rsquo;re screamin'</p><p>Barely stop to wonder why</p><hr><p>And I</p><p>Another lonely fool</p><p>It makes my brain ache,</p><p>To know, and wish to take</p><p>That last unstaged duel</p><p>To try</p><hr><p>Behold, be told</p><p>My strength is whole</p><p>My ears are not joined by a hole</p><p>It&rsquo;s one</p><p>Only one</p><p>One thing I need to know I&rsquo;ve done</p><p>Forget all else, that battle&rsquo;s won</p><p>And naught to show, but the constant sun</p><hr><p>Who are these who walks beside me</p><p>How is it they show no face</p><p>Why do they withold their voices</p><p>Heaven&rsquo;s far in such a place</p><p>Oh shadow, true mirror, on the wall</p><p>Why do you catch me when I fall</p><p>A lazy wretch stumbling through</p><p>Unable to live up to you</p><p>Yet I surpass your greedy ass</p><p>I&rsquo;m coming up so very fast</p><p>I&rsquo;ve done so much, am I your son</p><p>your story ends, mine&rsquo;s almost done</p><hr><p>Somebody tell me</p><p>Will I get a girlfriend</p><p>Do I have potential</p><p>What even happened in February of last year</p><p>What else but a rumor could ruin my moonlight</p><pre><code>oh stay on the sunny side,
