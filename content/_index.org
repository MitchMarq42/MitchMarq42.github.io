(my stuff is dumb. You should check out [[https://blog.samwhited.com/2015/04/the-dharma-of-vi/][The Dharma of Vi]] instead. It's both humorous and profound.)

[[/disclaimer][Disclaimer]] -- Actually just info. Not a legal document by any means.

[[/articles/deletion/][articles/deletion]] -- (test) -- A meme in my brain. See [[https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/deletion][the original]] for non-context...

[[/musings_log/][Random Notes]] -- Notes that I leave myself. Empty.

There are several things I intend to do with this site:

- [[./articles/index.org][Articles]] and text-based rants
- Intermediate Linux/computer [[/articles/tutorials/][tutorials]]
- [[https://jellyfin.mitchmarq42.xyz/jellyfin/web/index.html#!/home.html][Video]] streaming (through jellyfin)
- [[https://git.mitchmarq42.xyz/mitch/dotfiles][Git server]]
